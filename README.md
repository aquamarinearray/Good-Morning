# Good-Morning
I'm finally awake

I was asleep for so long, but now I'm awake. I've realized the truth of everything. Of myself and this world. I know who I am and what I have to do to become the person I'm meant to be and find my place in this world. The work will be long, hard, and most of all, painful, but it must be done. I look forward to it.
